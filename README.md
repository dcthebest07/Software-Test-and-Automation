# Software-Test-and-Automation
Throughout this course, I have learned a lot about code quality. I have found that I can ensure my code is functional and secure by running tests through things like JUnit 5. These tests are meant to be specific and unique, each individually testing a single component of my code. This ensures a high percentage of coverage from within the tests. In this specific git repository, the test coverage is over 90%. This is a great guideline for the actual production of software as I move into the professional world. As a developer, it is also important to interpret user needs and incorporate them into the final product. In this specific project, I worked closely with the user requirements to make sure that each use case was identified and tested. I approach designing software by starting with the requirements. My main focus when starting a new piece of software is the actual functionality and requirements. After that, I look at user retention. I try to make the software as appealing to the user as possible, and in doing so, I am able to walk through normal and abnormal use cases for testing.
